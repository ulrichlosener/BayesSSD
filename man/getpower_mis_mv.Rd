\arguments{
\item{attrition}{The attrition pattern (FALSE for no attrition, otherwise "weibull", "modified_weibull", "linear_exponential", "log_logistic", "gompertz" or "non-parametric")}

\item{params}{The parameters passed to the survival function specified in "attrition". First parameter is omega, second is gamma.}

\item{m}{The number of datasets simulated. The higher m, the more accurate the power level but the higher the computation cost}

\item{N}{The number of subjects}

\item{t.points}{The points in time of measurement. Can be non-equidistant.}

\item{var.u0}{The intercept variance.}

\item{var.u1}{The slope variance.}

\item{var.e}{The residual variance.}

\item{cov}{The covariance between intercept variance and slope variance.}

\item{eff.sizes}{The effect sizes defined as the differences between the regression coefficients of interaction between time and condition.}

\item{fraction}{The fraction of information used to construct the prior for the Bayes Factor.}

\item{log.grow}{Use log-linear growth?}

\item{seed}{Set a seed for reproducibility}

\item{hypothesis}{The hypothesis to be evaluated. Treatment groups are coded as "a", "b", "c", etc.}

\item{PMPthres}{The Threshold a Posterior Model Probability needs to exceed in order to be considered convincing evidence.}

\item{BFthres}{The Threshold a Bayes Factor needs to exceed in order to be considered convincing evidence.}
}
\value{
Returns the power when using a Bayes Factor and the power when using Posterior Model Probabilities.
