This is the repository for the R package `BayesSSD`. This package performs simulation-based Bayesian sample size determination for longitudinal experiments. Various patterns of attrition (drop out) can be taken into account by means of a number of parametric and non-parametric survival functions. 
You can download the package from GitHub via `devtools::install_github("ulrichlosener/BayesSSD")`.

The accompanying paper for the `BayesSSD` package authored by Ulrich LÃ¶sener and Mirjam Moerbeek is called "Bayesian Sample Size Determination for Longitudinal Trials with Attrition - the BayeSSD Package" and has been submitted to Psychological Methods.
